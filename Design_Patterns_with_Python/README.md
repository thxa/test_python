## [What Are Design Patterns?](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=a880a2a0-4d79-4b5f-a9da-c40411ebb11f)
<p>
	A design patterns is a model solution to a common
	design problem. It describes the problem and a general
	approach to solving it.
</p>


<p>
	"Each pattern describes a problem 
	which occurs over and over again in
	our enviroment and then describes
	the core of the solution to the problem"	
</p>


### Examples of Design patterns
<ul>
	<li>Building architecture</li>
	<li>Electracl and plumbing codes</li>
	<li>Automobile design</li>
	<li>Mobile phone interfaces</li>
</ul>

<p>
	We need design patterns to ensure 
	that our work is consistent, 
	reliable and understandable
</p>

<ul>	
	<li>Creational is Object creation</li>
	<li>Structural is Object relationships</li>
	<li>Behavioral is Object interaction and responsibility</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>S is Single responsibility</li>
	<li>O is Open-closed 
		<ul>
			<li>Open for extincion by inheritance</li>
			<li>Close for modification</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>L is Liskov substitution</li>
	<li>I is interface segregation as abc</li>
	<li>D is Dependency inversion</li>
</ul>
